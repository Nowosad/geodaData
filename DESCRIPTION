Description: The goal of geodaData is to store sample spatial datasets. These 
    datasets are intended to be used to teach basic spatial analysis concepts. 
    They are used in the weekly R Spatial Workshop at the Center for Spatial Data 
    Science at UChicago, and are based off of the GeoDa workbook and data site 
    developed by Luc Anselin and team.
